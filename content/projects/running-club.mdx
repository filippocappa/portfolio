## 01 — THE STARTING LINE

It began as a small Slack channel and an obsession with the quiet discipline of morning miles. In a university environment that often prioritizes late nights over early starts, I wanted to create a space where "serious fun" was the baseline. 

Building a community isn't just about showing up; it's about the logistics of belonging. We needed routes that worked for beginners, pacers who understood effort over ego, and a brand that felt like a team.

## 02 — THE LOGISTICS OF MILES

- **Systematic Routing:** Used Strava API data to map 12 unique campus loops, categorized by elevation and safety lighting for winter sessions.
- **Partnership Pipeline:** Negotiated with local independent running shops to provide "Starter Kits" for new members, lowering the barrier to entry for students.
- **Data-Driven Growth:** Tracked weekly attendance and pace distribution to adjust training blocks, ensuring we weren't just running, but improving.

## 03 — IMPACT & VELOCITY

The result was more than just a club. We became a hub for high-performance students who found clarity in the run. From securing major brand sponsorships to seeing members complete their first marathons, the club proved that community is the most powerful performance enhancer.
